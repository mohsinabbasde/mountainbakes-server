/**
 * Authorise a Finance Ledger request.
 *
 * This is `requireRole` one level up: the finance module's rules are not "which
 * role are you" but "which role are you AND what is this endpoint about". A
 * Finance Manager may approve a partner expense but not rewrite the share
 * percentages; an Accountant may raise the expense but not approve it; a Read
 * Only Auditor may see all of it and touch none of it.
 *
 * Super Admin is the interesting case and the reason this reads settings. The
 * brief says Admin may view reports but not modify finance records "unless
 * granted permission" — so `view` always passes for a super admin, and every
 * other permission is gated on the `allowSuperAdminWrite` toggle in Finance
 * Settings (off by default). That toggle is read per request rather than
 * captured at boot so revoking the grant takes effect immediately; the settings
 * read is served from the same 60-second in-process cache the rest of the app
 * uses, so it costs no round trip in the common case.
 *
 * Branch managers and production users never match — `financeCan` returns false
 * for them on every permission, including `view`.

/**
 * Administering a Finance Help Desk query — respond, assign, resolve, and change
 * or delete the finance record behind it.
 *
 * THIS IS THE BRIEF'S §6 AND §21, AND IT IS THE ONE PLACE THEY ARE ENFORCED.
 * Only an Admin may change the books through the Help Desk; a Finance user may
 * report, view and discuss. Every control the UI hides is re-decided here from
 * the JWT, because hiding a button is courtesy and refusing the request is the
 * boundary.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT one of the five `FinancePermission`s. Those describe acts on
 * the BOOKS in the ordinary workflow: `configure` is ledger heads and share
 * percentages, `adjust` is reversing a posted entry. Routing the Help Desk
 * through either would overload a permission with a meaning it does not have,
 * and would silently hand query deletion to anyone later granted `configure`
 * for an unrelated reason.
 *
 * TWO THINGS CHANGED IN MIGRATION 94, both deliberate and both worth stating.
 *
 * 1. `finance_admin` NO LONGER PASSES. Migration 60 gave it the queue; §3 of the
 *    brief now says a query must not be sent to another Finance user first, and
 *    a finance_admin is a Finance-module account. Its authority over the books
 *    elsewhere — approving a voucher, posting an entry — is untouched by this;
 *    only the Help Desk moved. A finance_admin raising and discussing queries
 *    still works, through `requireFinance('create')` like every other Finance
 *    role.
 *
 * 2. `allowSuperAdminWrite` IS NOT CONSULTED. That toggle (Finance Settings, off
 *    by default) guards a super admin writing to finance OUTSIDE this queue. The
 *    Help Desk IS the sanctioned channel for those corrections — every one
 *    carries a Query ID, a stated reason and a row in `finance_amendments` — so
 *    gating it on a flag that ships off would leave every query on a fresh
 *    install unanswerable, by the only role the brief names as the answerer.
 *    Keeping the toggle here would not be "safer"; it would be a queue that
 *    silently does not work.
 *
 * `financeHelpDeskCan(role, 'respond')` in the shared types is the same rule for
 * the UI, and the two are meant to be read together.

 * `allowSuperAdminWrite` defaults to OFF — so routing it through requireFinance
 * would lock the only role the workflow names out of the only step it names for
 * them, and every branch's income would sit at pending_verification forever.
 *
 * Verification moves no money (it advances a row from pending_verification to
 * pending_approval and posts nothing), so it is not a "modification of a finance
 * record" in the sense the toggle guards. Finance Admins and Managers may also
 * verify, so a finance team running without the admin step is not blocked.
