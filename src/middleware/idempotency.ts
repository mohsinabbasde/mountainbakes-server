/**
 * Replay protection for `Idempotency-Key`.
 *
 * The mobile client commits a transaction to its own database first and sends it
 * afterwards, so every send can be retried: after a timeout, after a dyno
 * restart, after the app is killed mid-request. Without this, a retry of a
 * request the server already processed applies it twice — a second sale, with
 * real money against it, that nobody is looking for.
 *
 * The key is the client's `client_operation_id`, minted once when the
 * transaction is created and identical on every attempt. Storage and the claim
 * decision live in migration 84; this is the HTTP layer around it.
 *
 *   no header          → straight through, unchanged. Every existing caller
 *                        (the web app included) is unaffected.
 *   first request      → claim, run the handler, record what it answered
 *   repeat, completed  → the ORIGINAL response, never re-run. Stored as jsonb,
 *                        so fields and values are the original ones and only
 *                        key order may differ
 *   repeat, in flight  → 503 + Retry-After. Come back shortly.
 *   repeat, stale      → 409. A previous attempt died without recording an
 *                        outcome; a person has to check before it is sent again.
 *   same key, new body → 422. A client bug, surfaced rather than papered over.
 *
 * ── WHY A FAILED REQUEST GIVES THE KEY BACK ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Only responses worth replaying are stored; everything else releases the claim.
 * A 409 'stock has changed' committed nothing, and storing it would mean the
 * queued sale could never succeed on a later retry — it would replay its own
 * refusal until a human deleted it. Releasing keeps the retry honest. The
 * exception is a request that failed AFTER moving something (a branch return
 * that committed three products before hitting a shortfall on the fourth):
 * `persistOn` keeps those, because re-running one double-applies the part that
 * did land.
