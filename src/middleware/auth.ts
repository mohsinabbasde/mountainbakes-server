/**
 * Sessions Login History has marked revoked, as this process has seen them.
 *
 * WHY THIS CACHE EXISTS AT ALL. The check below runs on EVERY authenticated
 * request in the app, and an uncached version would add a database round-trip to
 * each one — a real cost paid on every screen to catch a condition that is rare
 * by construction. So the answer is remembered, asymmetrically:
 *
 *   * A revocation is remembered FOREVER (until the process restarts). It cannot
 *     be undone — there is no un-revoke — so a cached `true` can never go stale
 *     in the dangerous direction.
 *   * "Not revoked" is remembered for one minute only, and that TTL is the
 *     longest a session Login History has marked can keep working on this
 *     check alone.
 *
 * BOUNDED. The negative map is capped and cleared wholesale rather than evicted
 * entry by entry; the cost of a cold cache is one extra query per live session,
 * which is not worth an LRU to avoid. The revoked set is not capped because its
 * membership is the number of sessions an admin has ever ended on this dyno,
 * which is small and self-limiting.
 *
 * PER-PROCESS, like `utils/cache.ts` and for the same reason: the deploy is a
 * single dyno. On a horizontally scaled API each instance would learn about a
 * revocation independently, within its own TTL — still bounded, and worth
 * swapping for Redis if that day comes.

 * the case where Login History marked its row and ending the session itself
 * then failed.
 *
 * FAILS OPEN, deliberately and in exactly one direction: a database error
 * answers "not revoked". This runs in front of every request in the app, so a
 * transient failure here that failed CLOSED would sign the entire company out of
 * a working system to enforce a revocation that has probably not happened.
