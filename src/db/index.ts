 * The database, as the rest of the API sees it.
 *
 *     const db = dbFor('orders');
 *     const { data, error } = await db.from('orders').select('*').eq('id', id).maybeSingle();
 *     const { data, error } = await db.rpc('commit_sale', { p_order, p_items });
 *
 * Each chain becomes one SQL statement, run on Prisma's connection (./builder,
 * ./rpc). Results and errors have the `{ data, error, count }` shape described
 * in ./types.
 *
 * The name given to `dbFor` says which part of the API is asking. Nothing is
 * decided by it; it is there so that a module's database access can be found,
 * and one day routed or measured, by name.
 *
 * New code that is not built on this chain should not come here at all: it uses
 * Prisma Client (`getPrisma()` in ./prisma), with its typed models and
 * `$transaction`.
