 * The feed is POLLED by every open tab, so it is the one read in the API whose
 * volume is set by a timer rather than by somebody doing something.
 *
 * That is why app.ts leaves it out of the app-wide limiter and it carries this
 * one instead. The app-wide limiter keys on `req.ip`, which without `trust
 * proxy` is a Heroku router address shared by unrelated users — a handful of
 * idle tabs polling would spend the allowance that real work needs. Keyed on
 * the authenticated user, a runaway client can only ever throttle itself.
 *
 * 240 per 15 minutes is one poll every 30 seconds from eight tabs.
