/**
 * Branch → discount claims. The raising half of the feature; Production's review
 * board is production-discounts.routes.ts.
 *
 * THE SPLIT IS THE SAME ONE RETURNS USE, and for the same reason: this router is
 * mounted behind `requireRole(super_admin, ...BRANCH_ROLES)` and Production's
 * behind `requireRole(super_admin, production_user)`, so neither file has to
 * re-check the caller's side of the transaction in every handler. A branch role
 * that asks for /api/production-discounts gets a 403 from the mount, not a
 * filtered list.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MOVES STOCK. That is what makes this file so much shorter than the
 * returns equivalent — no idempotency keys, no geofence gate, no compensating
 * movement to unwind, no InsufficientStockError. A claim is a row and an amount,
 * and correcting one is an ordinary update rather than a difference to settle.
 * (The geofence is deliberately not applied: `requireInsideGeofence` guards
 * PHYSICAL acts — counting stock, handing goods over — and a branch manager
 * chasing a short delivery from home is not the thing that guard exists to stop.)

 *
 * `isBranchRole` rather than a `=== 'branch_manager'` test, because a
