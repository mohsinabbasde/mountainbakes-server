//
//   here      branch balance ↓, record `pending`, Production notified

//
// The branch half still moves NOW, and deliberately: the goods have physically
// left the shop, and leaving them on the balance would let the counter sell
// stock that is already on its way to production. What waits for review is the
// pool credit — the claim that production actually received them.
//
// The gap between the two is what makes Change and Delete meaningful on the
// branch's Return Stock page: while the row is open the branch may still correct
// or withdraw it (`branch-returns.service.ts`), and once Production has decided
// it is final.
//
// Takes MANY products in one submission: a branch closing out an evening hands
// back everything unsold at once, and Production wants one notification for that,

// gives each call its own transaction, so a batch is not all-or-nothing. The
// pre-validation pass below closes the realistic failure (asking for more than is
// on hand) BEFORE anything is written. A concurrent sale landing between validate
// and commit can still fail a later row — the RPC refuses rather than driving the
// branch negative, and the 409 names what did commit. Those stay committed:
// they are real stock movements, and silently reversing them would be worse.
// True all-or-nothing needs a commit_branch_return_batch(p_items jsonb) function.
// `persistIfCommitted` rather than the default: this route commits product by
// product and its 409 reports what already moved before a shortfall stopped it.

// `apply_stock_correction` takes ABSOLUTE targets, sizes each compensating
// movement against the live figures under a row lock, refuses to drive a balance
// negative, and appends the whole thing to `stock_history` — so an admin edit is
// as auditable as a sale and cannot silently lose a concurrent one. The only
// difference from the ticket path is the ref_id prefix (`admin:<uid>`), which is
// what tells the two apart in the ledger afterwards.
