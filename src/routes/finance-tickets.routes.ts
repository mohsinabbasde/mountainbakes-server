/**
 * /api/finance/tickets — the Finance Help Desk.
 *
 *     Finance User  →  Finance Help Desk  →  ADMIN
 *
 * A Finance user REPORTS, VIEWS and DISCUSSES. An Admin — and only an Admin —
 * responds, moves the query along, and changes, amends, overwrites or deletes
 * the finance record behind it. That is the brief's §21, and the split runs
 * through every route below: the reporting half sits behind `requireFinance`,
 * the acting half behind `requireFinanceHelpDeskAdmin`.
 *
 * Migration 94 reversed migration 60 here, and the reversal is the thing most
 * likely to surprise: the queue used to belong to `finance_admin`, and no longer
 * does. See requireFinanceHelpDeskAdmin's own header for why, and for why the
 * `allowSuperAdminWrite` toggle is deliberately not consulted.
 *
 * Four things are deliberate and worth not "tidying" later:
 *
 *   1. The snapshot is the WHOLE source row, not a hand-picked subset. Picking
 *      columns means guessing which ones matter to whoever reads the query in
 *      three months, and silently losing a column when the source table grows.
 *   2. A reference is OPTIONAL. "Calculation Issue" and "Other" name no single
 *      record, and forcing a raiser to invent one sends the admin to the wrong
 *      row.
 *   3. Nothing is destroyed. Delete is `soft_delete_finance_record` — a stamp —
 *      and the query itself is stamped too. Migration 60's real delete is gone.
 *   4. Every write that touches the BOOKS goes through one handler
 *      (`applyRecordChange`) so the amendment record, the audit row and the
 *      notification cannot be written for one verb and forgotten for another.

/**
 * §12 — a resolution is disputed, and the query goes live again.
 *
 *     RESOLVED  →  REOPENED  →  UNDER_REVIEW
 *
 * ONE ROUTE, TWO OUTCOMES, decided from the JWT and not from the payload:
 *
 *   · An Admin REOPENS the query. The resolution being overturned is archived
 *     onto `resolution_history` in the same UPDATE that clears it, so there is
 *     no instant at which the query has neither the old answer nor a record of
 *     it, and no way for a failure between two writes to lose one.
 *   · The Finance RAISER records a REQUEST to reopen. §12 says either side may
 *     ask "depending on permissions", and a Finance user's permission is to ask:
 *     the request is posted as a message on the thread — where it is
 *     append-only and the admin's reply sits beside it — and the admin is
 *     notified. The status does not move, which is the whole difference.
 *
 * Anyone else who reaches here is a Finance user looking at somebody else's
 * query, and `canSee` has already turned them away.
 *
 * WHY NOT PATCH /:id/status WITH status='reopened'. Because reopening is the one
 * transition that must UNDO a previous write rather than follow it, and the undo
 * has a precondition — archive first — that no other transition has. Expressed
 * as a row in FINANCE_TICKET_TRANSITIONS it would be a branch every other
 * transition skips, and the archive step would be one `if` away from being
 * forgotten by the next person who adds a status.
