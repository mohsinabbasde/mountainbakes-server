/**
 * Production → Discounts: the queue of money branches are claiming back.
 *
 * The deliberate twin of production-returns.routes.ts. Same four states, same
 * three decisions, same atomic check-and-set on review — so that Production
 * learns one board and reads two.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE IS THE POINT. A return review has to get stock right: which
 * side has already moved, what acceptance credits, what rejection puts back, and
 * an idempotency key under all of it because the movements commit in a separate
 * transaction from the status. A discount moves nothing. Approving one is a
 * status write and a notification. There is no pool to credit, no branch balance
 * to unwind, and so nothing here that can leave stock and paperwork disagreeing.
 *
 * That is why 'returned' is offered unconditionally, where the returns route has
 * to refuse it on Production-recorded rows: every claim in this table was raised
 * by a branch, so there is always branch paperwork to hand back.
