/**
 * Daily Sale Record — `/api/daily-sale-records`.
 *
 * ─── Who may open it (§1) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `super_admin` and BOTH branch roles. A `branch_user` is included deliberately
 * and it is the exception to the note on BRANCH_ROLES about reporting surfaces
 * naming `branch_manager` literally: the shift account is the person who
 * physically counts the drawer, and a reconciliation only that person's manager
 * could enter is a reconciliation entered from memory the next morning.
 *
 * `production_user` and every finance role are absent. Production never handles a
 * branch's till, and Finance reads these figures through its own Branch Income
 * screen (finance-income.routes.ts), which is a different question — what the
 * company may bank — asked of the same day.
 *
 * ─── What each role may DO is decided per endpoint, not here ─────────────────
 *   feed            branch roles + admin   (locks decided per method, in SQL)
 *   verify          branch_manager + admin — a shift counts, a manager signs off
 *   lock / unlock   admin only
 *   amend           admin only
 *   set a lock      admin only
 *
 * Verification is granted to `branch_manager` rather than kept admin-only because
 * §20 lists Verify among the actions a branch sees, and because a company with
 * four shops cannot have one person sign off four drawers every night. What stays
 * admin-only is everything that CLOSES a record or CHANGES a signed figure.
 *
 * ─── Nothing here computes money ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every figure comes from Postgres (migration 101). This file resolves whose data
 * the caller is asking about — from the JWT, never from the query string — and
 * hands it on. See daily-sale.service.ts.
