/**
 * The difference figures for one Daily Sale Record.
 *
 * ─── Why this exists when the database already computes them ─────────────────
 * `daily_sale_records` carries `cash_difference`, `easypaisa_difference`,
 * `bank_difference` and `overall_difference` as GENERATED columns (migration
 * 101). Those are the durable record — impossible to falsify, and what any
 * SQL-side report reads.
 *
 * This is the same formula for the one case the generated columns cannot cover:
 * a record that is still OPEN, whose auto figures are re-derived from `orders` on
 * every read so the branch is counting against what the till says now rather than
 * against a snapshot taken at breakfast. The stored columns are computed from the
 * stored snapshot; this computes from the presented one.
 *
 * For a FROZEN record (verified / locked / amended) the presented auto figures
 * ARE the stored ones, so this returns exactly what the generated columns hold —
 * by construction, not by coincidence. That is what makes one formula in one
 * place safe: the two agree wherever they overlap.
 *
 * Shared because the API composes the list with it and the client's View popup
 * and print sheet read the same numbers, and a screen that disagreed with its own
 * printout by one counted figure is not a cosmetic problem.
