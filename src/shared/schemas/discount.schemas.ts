// ── Branch Discount requests ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A branch claims money back against a demand it raised. `branchId` is NEVER in
// any schema here: it is derived server-side from the caller's JWT, the same rule
// CreateBranchReturnSchema follows. A branch that could name its own branch could
// name someone else's.

/**
 * Money, to two decimal places, positive.
 *
 * `.multipleOf(0.01)` rather than an integer: a discount is currency and 250.50
 * is a real claim, but 250.505 is a typo the database column (numeric(14,2))
 * would silently round — refusing it here is the difference between the branch
 * fixing a digit and the record quietly disagreeing with what was typed.
 *
 * The upper bound is a fat-finger guard, not a policy limit. Nothing about the
 * business caps a discount; what this catches is the missing decimal point that
 * turns 500 into 50000000 on a screen where the branch is typing quickly.

 * A reason is MANDATORY, and unlike a branch return's it may not be blank.
 *
 * An end-of-day return is self-explanatory — the goods are in the crate — which
 * is why CreateBranchReturnSchema lets its reason default to ''. A sum of money
 * is not: "the branch is owed 500" with no cause is not something Production can
 * approve or refuse, only guess at. The one field that makes the claim reviewable
 * is the one field that cannot be empty.

 * Correcting a claim the branch still owns — 'pending' or 'returned' only.

 * Unlike ReviseBranchReturnSchema, this really is a draft edit: no stock moved
 * when the claim was raised, so there is no difference to settle and no direction
 * for the server to work out. The new amount simply replaces the old one.
 *
 * The demand is deliberately absent. Re-pointing a claim at a different delivery
 * is not a correction of this claim — it is a different claim, and Production may
 * already have looked at this one. Withdraw and raise it again.

 * The three decisions Production can take on a pending claim.
 *
 * 'returned' hands it back to the branch to correct and is NOT terminal — it is
 * the one outcome the branch can act on afterwards, and it is why `reviewNote` is
 * required for it: "Sent Back" with no note asks the branch to fix something
 * without saying what, which is how a claim bounces twice.
 *
 * A rejection may carry a note and does not have to. It is final either way and
 * there is nothing for the branch to do with it, so a mandatory note there would
 * be a box to fill rather than a message to send — but a rejection over money is
 * exactly where one is worth writing, so the field stays offered.
