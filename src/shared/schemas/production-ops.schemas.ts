// ── Correcting a branch-initiated return (Branch → Return Stock) ─────────────
// Only valid while the return is still open — 'pending' or 'returned'. Once
// Production has accepted or rejected it the record is final and the server
// refuses this with a 409; the client hides the button for the same reason.
//
// Even open, this is NOT a draft edit: the branch half of the movement has
// already happened (the units came off the balance as the return was saved), so
// this is a request to move the DIFFERENCE. `qty` is the return's new total, not
// a delta — the client shows the figure that is on the record and the server
// works out which way stock has to go, which is the only reading that stays
// right if two corrections race.
//
// `reason` is optional and, unlike the Production-recorded flow, may be blank —
// it mirrors CreateBranchReturnSchema above, where an end-of-day batch carries
// one shared reason and often none at all.
