/**
 * Must stay in lockstep with the Postgres `notification_type` enum — that enum is
 * the authority, and `notifications.type` is `not null` against it, so a value
 * missing there fails the insert with a raw 22P02. The enum is declared in
 * migration 01 and extended by 14 (`password_reset`), 25 (the two `support_*`),
 * 42 (the six `event_*`), 72 (`production_demand_cancelled`) and 92 (the two
 * `branch_discount*`).
 *
 * Note `notify()` takes `type: string`, not this union (services/push.service.ts) —
 * nothing mechanically enforces the match, so add values in BOTH places.

  // different audiences: a claim raised goes to Production, a claim decided goes
  // back to the branch.

  //
  // The TARGET of the first one changed in migration 94: a query now goes
  // straight to the ADMIN, never to a Finance Admin first (§3 of the Help Desk
  // brief). The value is unchanged because the notifications already delivered
  // under it mean the same thing — "somebody raised a finance query" — and
  // renaming an enum value would orphan every row carrying the old one.
  | 'finance_query' // a Finance user raised a query → Admin
  | 'finance_query_resolved' // Admin resolved/rejected/closed it → raiser
  | 'finance_query_updated' // Admin moved it along (under review, needs info) → raiser
  | 'finance_query_message' // either side added to the conversation → the other side
  | 'finance_query_amended' // Admin changed or deleted the record behind it → raiser
  // Branch shift accounts (migration 65) — branch_manager asks, Admin decides
  | 'branch_user_requested' // a manager forwarded a request for a shift account → Admin
  | 'branch_user_reviewed' // Admin approved or rejected it → the requesting manager
  // Special Events (migration 42)
  | 'event_created' // a new event was published → branches + Production
  | 'event_reminder' // a scheduled countdown reminder fired → branch or Production
  | 'event_demand_due' // the branch demand deadline is tomorrow → branch
  | 'event_demand_submitted' // a branch submitted its advance demand → Production
  | 'event_demand_reviewed' // Production/Admin approved or rejected a demand → branch
  | 'event_production_updated' // a preparation stage moved → Admin
  // Session security (migration 97/98)
  | 'security_alert'; // a sign-in tripped the suspicion detector → Admin
