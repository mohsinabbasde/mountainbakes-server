/**
 * How a Production Stock row fits together.
 *
 * ── THE LEDGER IS THE TRUTH ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `production_stock_history` is append-only: one signed `delta` per movement,
 * stamped with the business date it belongs to. Every figure below is folded out
 * of it. Nothing here is a stored, editable number, and no code path assigns a
 * balance — a mistake is corrected by a REVERSAL, never by an edit.
 *
 * ── OPENING NEEDS NO CLOSING JOB ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *     opening(D) = Σ delta WHERE business_date < D
 *
 * which IS the previous business day's closing balance, by construction. There is
 * nothing to reset, nothing to snapshot, and no 02:00 job to miss — which matters,
 * because the node-cron schedulers in this project are all commented out, so a
 * carry-forward that depended on one would silently never happen. The date
 * changing does not zero anything: yesterday's balance simply keeps being the sum
 * that it was.
 *
 * ── THE ARITHMETIC ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *     totalStock = opening + preparedToday
 *     balance    = opening + preparedToday + returned + adjustment
 *                  − demandFulfilled − soldToday
 *     available  = balance − branchDemand
 *
 * `adjustment` is SIGNED, so the spec's "+ positive adjustments − negative
 * adjustments" is one addition of a number that may be negative. `returned` is
 * ADDED (accepted returns only — see below). Every figure is counted exactly once.
 *
 * Note what `balance` does NOT subtract: OUTSTANDING branch demand. A branch
 * asking for goods does not consume them, and reducing the pool at submission
 * would report stock as gone while it is still on the shelf. Stock leaves when the
 * branch VERIFIES the delivery — that is `demandFulfilled`, and it is the only
 * demand figure inside the balance.
 *
 * `balance` is therefore exactly Σ delta over the whole ledger up to the date,
 * which is why it is also the next day's `opening` with no further work.
 *
 * ── BRANCH DEMAND IS A CLAIM, NOT A MOVEMENT ─────────────────────────────────
 * `branchDemand` is what branches are still owed: submitted or approved and not
 * yet verified. It is read live off `production_orders` and is NOT in the ledger,
 * because writing it there would double-count against the `transfer_out` booked
 * when the same goods are verified out.
 *
 * It is displayed beside the balance rather than subtracted from it, and the two
 * are compared by `stockStatus` — which is what turns "we hold 15, we owe 25" into
 * a shortage the floor can act on instead of a negative number with no explanation.

 *                central pool has NOT been credited yet.
 * - `returned` — Production handed it back to the branch to correct. Same stock
 *                position as `pending`, moves nothing on its own; the branch
 *                fixes the figure and resubmits, which returns it to `pending`.
 * - `accepted` — Production took it. The pool is credited. Final.
 * - `rejected` — Production refused it. The units go back onto the branch
 *                balance. Final.
 *
 * `pending` and `returned` are the ONLY states in which a branch may change or
