 * Finance Ledger — the accounts department's own module.

 * through every type below.
 *
 *   1. Nothing here is ever edited in place once posted. A mistake is corrected
 *      with a reversing or adjustment entry that leaves the original visible.
 *      That is why `LedgerEntry` has no `updatedAt` and no update payload type.
 *   2. Every amount that reaches the ledger has passed an approval, and the
 *      approval is recorded on the SOURCE document (a FinanceTransaction, a
 *      SalaryPayment, …) rather than on the ledger row. The ledger row is the
 *      consequence; the source document is the decision.
 *
 * Money is `numeric(14,2)` in Postgres and therefore arrives from PostgREST as a
 * STRING. Every service in this module coerces with Number() at the boundary —
 * see the note on `coerceToDefaultType` in settings.service.ts for what happens
 * when that is forgotten.

 * role — `finance_admin` included — is on the reporting side.
 *
 * That last part is a deliberate reversal of migration 60, which gave the queue
 * to `finance_admin`, and it is worth knowing why rather than discovering it: §3
 * of the brief says a query must not go to another Finance user first, and a
 * finance_admin is a Finance-module account. Its authority over the BOOKS
 * elsewhere — approving a voucher, posting an entry — is untouched by this; only
 * the Help Desk moved.
 *
 * Note what this function does NOT consult: `allowSuperAdminWrite`. That toggle
 * (Finance Settings, off by default) guards a super admin writing to finance
 * OUTSIDE this queue. The Help Desk is the sanctioned, audited channel for
 * exactly those corrections — every one of them carries a Query ID and an
 * amendment record — so gating it on a flag that ships off would leave every
 * query unanswerable on a fresh install.
 *
 * NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY on the client. It decides which buttons render;
 * `requireFinanceHelpDeskAdmin()` on the API decides the same thing again from
 * the JWT, which is where the real answer lives.
