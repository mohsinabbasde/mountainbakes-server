// It is corrected through its own editor — PATCH /api/support/:id/demand-items,
// backed by correct_production_order (migration 77) — because a demand is a
// workflow document rather than a ledger row: its lines carry BOTH a requested
// qty and an approved qty, and whether a change to the latter owes anyone stock
// depends on whether the order was ever delivered. A rejected or cancelled
// demand stays uncorrectable; see `readOnly` below.
//
// 'system' is not raised by a human against a lookupable ID — it is opened
// automatically when an unattended job fails (e.g. the 2 AM closing summary could
// not be generated or delivered). Such a ticket has no editable reference, so its
// referenceSnapshot is null and the failure detail lives in `message`.
