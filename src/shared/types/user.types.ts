/**
 * Every role the app recognises.
 *
 * The four `finance_*` / `accountant` values were added by migration 51 for the
 * Finance Ledger module. They are ordinary
 * members of the `user_role` Postgres enum rather than a parallel claim, so RLS
 * (`app.jwt_role()`), the API's `requireRole()` and the client's RouteGuard all
 * keep working unchanged.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS to nothing here, but every value must exist in the Postgres
 * enum — a drift surfaces as a runtime 22P02 on the first insert.
 *
 * The enum still holds `branch_user` (migration 65): Postgres cannot drop an
 * enum value in place. The shift-account role was removed by migration 122,
 * which deleted every such account and added `users_no_branch_user`, so the
 * value can never be assigned again and has no place in this list.
