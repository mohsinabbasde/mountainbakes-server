  // Geofencing (migration 48). These are the first entries that target something
  // other than a user, which is why they carry no target_user_id — the affected
  // subject is named in `details` instead. Worth auditing because widening a
  // branch's radius, or deleting its location outright, silently removes the
  // restriction on where that branch may sell from.

  // Session security (migration 98). The first entries that record an admin
  // acting ON somebody's session rather than on their account. Both target a
  // user, so `target_user_id` is populated; `details` names the device, the
  // resolved location and the admin's stated reason, because "revoked a session"
  // without which session is not an audit trail.
  //
  // There is deliberately NO 'login' or 'logout' action here. Every sign-in and
  // sign-out already writes a `login_sessions` row carrying strictly more than
  // an audit line could — IP, device, location, duration — and duplicating them
  // into audit_logs would double the busiest write in the app to say less.

  // Migration 99. The only READ in this list, and the only one written by an
  // action that changes nothing — which is exactly why it is here. The session
  // detail view is where an admin sees another person's activated email address,
  // IP address and resolved location; that is the most sensitive thing this app
  // shows anybody, and "who looked at whose session, and when" is a question the
  // audit trail has to be able to answer about the admins themselves.
  //
  // Written ONLY for a super admin opening SOMEBODY ELSE'S session. An admin
  // opening their own would fill the log with rows about a person reading their
  // own record, which is not a privileged act and would bury the ones that are.
