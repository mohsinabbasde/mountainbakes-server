// Daily Sale Record — one branch, one business day, reconciled.
//
// The record answers three questions in one row: what the sales system says was
// taken (AUTO), what a person physically counted (MANUAL), and the difference.
// It is a REPORTING LAYER over `orders` and `expenses` and modifies neither; a
// wrong auto figure means a wrong sale, corrected by correcting the sale.
//
// See migration 101 for the tables and the six functions every write goes
// through. Nothing here is computed on the client — the differences arrive as
// generated columns, and the helpers below only decide how to LABEL them.
