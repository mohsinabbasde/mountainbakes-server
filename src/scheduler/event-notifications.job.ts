/**
 * Two Special Events jobs, both pinned to Asia/Karachi by node-cron's `timezone`
 * option regardless of the server's own TZ.
 *
 * ─── 09:00 — send the day's due reminders ────────────────────────────────────
 * Deliberately NOT 2 AM. These reminders are read by branch managers and
 * production staff, so they should land in working hours; and 2 AM is already
 * contended by the daily closing and price activation. The dispatch is idempotent
 * (claim-based), so an accidental double-fire is a no-op, and the
 * eventNotificationsEnabled toggle is checked inside the job at fire time.
 *
 * ─── 02:30 — maintenance ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * After the business-day rollover and before anyone is looking: refresh the
 * Hijri estimates for unconfirmed events, advance upcoming → active → completed,
 * and create next year's occurrences for recurring series. Ordered so that a
 * freshly rolled-forward event already has its estimate when the reminder
 * schedule is next built.
 *
 * Like the other two schedulers, the idempotency here assumes a SINGLE dyno
 * (web=1). The claim is safe against concurrent claimers, but the stale-claim
 * sweep is not written for a fleet.
