/**
 * Photo attachments — upload, bind, and read-time URL signing.
 *
 * Three things about this module are load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **The bucket is private.** Nothing here ever returns a storage path to a
 *      client; it returns a signed URL with a one-hour life. `<img src>` cannot
 *      send an Authorization header, so a signed URL is the only way a private
 *      object renders in the browser — and the expiry is the point, since these
 *      are expense receipts and delivery photos.
 *   2. **Upload precedes the parent row.** A photo is required on the same
 *      request that creates its document, so it cannot be uploaded with the
 *      parent's id. `uploadAttachment` writes a STAGED row (entity_id null);
 *      `bindAttachments` claims it once the parent exists. See migration 67.
 *   3. **Signing is batched.** One call signs a whole list; a ledger page of
 *      100 entries must not become 100 round-trips to Storage.
 *
 * Where the bytes live is `file-store.ts`'s business (Supabase Storage or S3,
 * by FILE_STORAGE_DRIVER). This module only ever names a file by its path.
