 * Server-side geofencing.
 *
 * This is the enforcing copy. The browser runs the same `evaluateGeofence` from
 * `shared/utils/geo`, but only to decide what to render — a patched client, or a
 * request replayed straight at the API, never reaches that code at all. Everything
 * that actually refuses a sale is here.
 *
 * What that does and does not buy you is worth stating plainly: a browser cannot
 * attest that a coordinate came from real GPS hardware. Chrome's sensor override
 * and a two-line patch of `navigator.geolocation` both produce a position this code
 * cannot distinguish from a genuine one. So the goal is NOT "unspoofable" — it is
 * that every attempt is measured by the server against data the client does not
 * supply (the branch centre and radius come from the database, never the request),
 * and that every attempt lands in `geofence_logs` with its IP and user agent
 * attached. Bypass becomes visible and attributable rather than impossible.
