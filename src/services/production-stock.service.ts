/**
 * Central Production Stock pool (no cron). Mirrors the derived-stock approach in
 * `stock.service.ts` but for a single, branch-agnostic pool: every movement is
 * appended to `production_stock_history`, and the day is rebuilt from it.
 *
 * ── THE POOL IS DAY-SCOPED. THERE IS NO CARRY-FORWARD. ──────────────────────
 * `production_stock.balance` is still written — it is the ledger's own running
 * total and the source of each history row's `balance_after` — but NOTHING in
 * this module reads it any more, and no figure this module returns is derived
 * from it. `balance` is Σ delta over the whole ledger up to the date, which is
 * why it is simultaneously the day's closing figure and the next day's opening.
 *
 * That is deliberate, not an oversight. The bakery bakes fresh every morning, so
 * a running total that never resets only ever misreported today: a product whose
 * pool sat at −40 showed the 50 units made this morning as −40-and-rising, the
 * counter refused to sell stock that was physically on the shelf, and the Demand
 * Summary showed a shortfall nobody could bake away. Reading the day on its own
 * puts newly prepared stock on the positive figure it actually is.
 *
 * Stock therefore enters the pool ONE way: by being prepared (or returned into
 * it) on the day it is sold from.
 *
 * The read-modify-write lives in apply_production_stock_movement (migration 15)
 * for the same reason as branch stock: PostgREST gives each call its own
 * transaction, so a ledger read and its write cannot be made atomic from here.
 *
 * Idempotency is the UNIQUE (ref_id, product_id, type) — a retry that reuses the
 * same refId is a no-op. A negative day is allowed (flagged in the UI, never
 * blocked) for everything except a counter sale, which is a decision at the till
 * rather than a record of something that already happened — see
 * commitProductionSaleTransaction.

 * The lifecycle is pending → awaiting_verification → verified → approved, and
 * stock leaves at VERIFY, not at review (migration 58):
 *
 *   · `pending`                — submitted, unreviewed. Claimed, still on the shelf.
 *   · `awaiting_verification`  — Production committed to sending it; the branch has
 *                                not counted it in. STILL on the shelf.
 *   · `verified`               — counted in, `transfer_out` written. Gone.
 *   · `approved`               — Production's closing sign-off AFTER verification.
 *                                Stock moved at the previous step; claims nothing.
 *   · `rejected` / `cancelled` — never will.
 *
 * So the outstanding pair is pending + awaiting_verification. Counting `approved`
 * would double-count every completed order: its units are already out of the
 * ledger via transfer_out, and adding them back as a claim would make a finished
 * demand permanently suppress the pool.
 *
 * Quantity per line: `qty` while pending (nobody has decided how much to send),
 * `approved_qty` once Production has decided. `?? qty` covers a row whose
 * approved_qty was never written.

 * corrected by another movement, never by overwriting the first.
 *
 * The reason is checked twice, here and in SQL. The schema catches a caller that
