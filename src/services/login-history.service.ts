/**
 * End one session, for real.
 *
 * TWO MECHANISMS, AND BOTH ARE NECESSARY.
 *
 *   1. `revoke_auth_session` deletes the GoTrue session, which cascades away its
 *      refresh token. The browser is out for good — but not immediately: a
 *      Supabase ACCESS token is stateless and stays valid until it expires, so
 *      there is a window of up to one token lifetime in which the revoked
 *      browser can still call the API.
 *   2. Marking the row revoked closes that window from the other side. The ping
 *      every open tab already sends answers 403 on a revoked row and the client
 *      signs itself out, so the practical lag is the two-minute ping tick.
 *
 * Neither is sufficient alone. The ping can be ignored by a tampered client that
 * simply stops pinging; the GoTrue delete is invisible until a refresh falls
 * due. Together they cover each other, which is the whole reason this function
 * does two things instead of one.
 *
 * ORDER IS DELIBERATE: GoTrue first, our row second. If the process dies between
 * them, the session is genuinely dead and our record merely says it is still
 * open — a history that understates. The reverse order would leave a row marked
 * revoked over a browser that was never actually signed out, which is a history
 * that LIES in the direction an admin would act on.
