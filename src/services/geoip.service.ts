 * fact; the city it was made from is a nicety. So every failure path here
 * returns empty rather than throwing: a provider outage, a rate limit, a
 * malformed answer and a slow network all end in the same place, and the session
 * row is written with null geo columns.
 *
 * PROVIDER. ipapi.co over HTTPS, no account and no key. Chosen over the more
 * commonly cited ip-api.com because that one is plaintext HTTP on its free tier,
 * and shipping staff IP addresses across the internet unencrypted to learn a
 * city name is a bad trade. The free tier is ~1,000 lookups a day, which this
 * uses a tiny fraction of: one lookup per NEW session, never per ping, and
 * cached per IP on top of that. `GEOIP_URL` overrides the endpoint if you later
 * move to a paid provider — it is a template with `{ip}` in it.
 *
 * PRIVACY. The IP is sent to a third party. Nothing else is: not the email, not
 * the role, not the branch. If that trade is unwanted, set `GEOIP_ENABLED=false`
 * and the columns stay null while everything else keeps working.
