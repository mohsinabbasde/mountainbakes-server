-- 84: replay protection for client-supplied Idempotency-Key headers.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. The mobile app writes offline: a sale, an expense or a demand
-- is committed to SQLite and queued, then sent when the signal comes back. Every
-- queued send can be retried — after a timeout, after a dyno restart, after the
-- app is killed mid-request — and until now a retry of a request the server had
-- ALREADY PROCESSED applied it a second time. That is a duplicate sale with real
-- money against it, and it is the single reason the web client's own write queue
-- has been left disabled since it was written.
--
-- WHAT ALREADY EXISTED, AND WHY IT IS NOT THIS. `stock_history` and
-- `production_stock_history` carry unique (ref_id, product_id, type) and every
-- stock RPC inserts `on conflict do nothing`, applying the balance delta only if
-- the insert landed. That dedupe is real but SERVER-INTERNAL: `ref_id` is minted
-- inside the request (an order id, a fresh uuid), so two deliveries of the same
-- HTTP request mint two ref_ids and both apply. Nothing upstream of the RPC knew
-- the two requests were the same request. This table is that missing layer, and
-- it is deliberately the same claim-or-noop shape as the rest of the codebase.
--
-- ── SCOPED PER USER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- The primary key is (user_id, key), not key alone. Keys are UUIDv7 minted on a
-- device, so a collision between two people is not a practical worry — but the
-- stored response body is returned verbatim on replay, and a key-only PK would
-- mean anyone who guessed or captured another account's key could read that
-- account's response. Scoping makes that impossible rather than improbable.
--
-- ── WHAT IS STORED, AND WHAT IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Only responses the API layer decides to keep are recorded, which in practice
-- means the successful ones plus the narrow class of failures that still moved
-- something (a partial branch return, which reports what it committed before it
-- hit a shortfall). A rejected request has no side effect to protect, so its
-- claim is RELEASED — that is what lets a 409 'stock has changed' be genuinely
-- re-attempted later instead of replaying its own refusal forever.
--
-- ── THE STALE CLAIM, AND WHY IT IS NOT RETRIED AUTOMATICALLY ───────────────
--
-- A claim sits `in_progress` between the request arriving and its response being
-- recorded. If the process dies in that window the row is left behind, and there
-- is no way to know from here whether the transaction committed. The tempting
-- fix — expire the claim and let the retry through — is exactly the double-apply
-- this table exists to prevent, so it is NOT what happens: a fresh claim asks the
-- caller to retry shortly (503) and a stale one is reported as a conflict for a
-- human to check. An operation stuck for a person to look at is recoverable; a
-- second sale nobody notices is not.
