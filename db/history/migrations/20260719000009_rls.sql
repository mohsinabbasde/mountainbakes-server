-- 09: Row Level Security.
--
-- READ THIS BEFORE EDITING ANY POLICY BELOW.
--
-- There are two classes of table in this schema, and they need opposite levels
-- of paranoia:
--
--   A. API-OWNED tables (everything except chat/presence/notifications). The
--      Express API reaches these with the SECRET key, which BYPASSES RLS
--      entirely. Authorization for these is enforced in application code — e.g.
--      branch managers scoped to their own branch_id, production users limited
--      to active order statuses — exactly as it was under the legacy admin
--      SDK, which likewise bypassed database rules. The policies here are
--      DEFENCE IN DEPTH: they matter only if a publishable-key client ever
--      reaches these tables directly. Do not delete the application-level checks
--      on the strength of these policies.
--
--   B. CLIENT-OWNED tables (chats, chat_participants, chat_messages,
--      user_presence, notifications). The browser talks to these directly with
--      the user's JWT, and Realtime subscriptions are filtered by exactly these
--      policies. Here RLS is the ONLY thing standing between one user and
--      another's messages. Treat changes to these as security changes.
--
-- Every table gets RLS enabled. A table with RLS on and no policy denies all
-- access to non-secret-key callers, which is the correct default — so tables
-- that the client should never touch simply get no policy at all.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Enable RLS everywhere. Default-deny.

-- Chat membership lookup.
--
-- This MUST be SECURITY DEFINER. Every chat policy needs to ask "is the caller a
-- participant of this chat?", which means reading chat_participants — but
-- chat_participants itself has a SELECT policy, so a plain subquery there causes
-- Postgres to re-evaluate that policy while it is already evaluating it:
--   ERROR: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "chat_participants"
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER runs the lookup as the function owner, which bypasses RLS on
-- the inner read and breaks the cycle. search_path is pinned so the definer
-- rights cannot be hijacked by a caller-controlled search_path.
--
-- Do not "simplify" this back into an inline EXISTS on chat_participants.
